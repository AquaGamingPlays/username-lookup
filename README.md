# Username-Lookup
Username Lookup for Minecraft.

Site: lookup.tanpug.rocks

IMPORTANT: At this time, the site will not work due to the vps I am passing the json through (due to CORS) is not using https. If you're on Chrome, allow insecure content ONLY on this site. If you're on Firefox, disable protection ONLY on this site. If you're on any other browser, disable https/secure connection just to this subdomain. Hopefully you would trust the site, because it is open source.

Many updates are going to come such as caching and username history lookup instead of only user lookup.
